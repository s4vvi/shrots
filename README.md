<h1 align="center">Shrots - A Fast Way To Memorize Shortcuts</h1>

![](https://s4vvi.com/blog/shrots/img/sh-demo.png)


**Shrots** is a dead simple program written in Rust, that shows a prewritten configuration file in the form of a program, shortcuts, and details. This is a great way to memorize shortcuts for tools, as this program can be binded to a shortcut for quick access.


Note that there are a few things to keep in mind before using this program:
- This is the first program I've written in Rust.
- Shrots have only been tested Arch I3VM.
- It's intended to be as simple as possible.
- There are a lot of things that need to be added.
